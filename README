To compile

first type:

make

the program should compile.

To run the program create an input file as follows
potential_filename
coordinate_filename (must contain dummy atoms)
ElementA ElementB (i.e Pt Pd)
1 10 15 21
9 14 20 25
Prefix (i.e Homotop_)
**LOGSDAIL ADDITION** minimise (optional; minimise structure)
**LOGSDAIL ADDITION** cutoff (optional; use cutoff if minimising structure)

The numbers seperated by whitespace are used to identify which group of atoms
belong to which subshell, each pair is the start and finish of atoms in a subshell. See LT_98_Coordinate.xyz and ExampleInput for help.

To run LT_98 example type ./Permute ExampleInput

**LOGSDAIL ADDITION** By default now structures are not minimised

TO DO:
- identify equivalent atom groupings via symmetry
